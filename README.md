## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://rossfahan.github.io/calendar-planner)

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and uses the Day.js API to handle date and time.

Each hour is color coded to indicate if it is in the past, the current hour, or upcoming.

## Learning Points 


This project taught me how to implement APIs, and work with jQuery to generate a dynamic layout. I also learned to go in depth and parse through documentation to find all available methods and understand their functionality. This project also taught me the importance of pseudo-code to and thinking through problems in order to implement a solution.
